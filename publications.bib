	abstract = {Most adaptive system identification analyses assume the length of the adaptive filter to match the length of the unknown system response. This assumption tends to be unrealistic, and its conclusions may not apply to some practical applications. The behavior of deficient length adaptive filters has been studied using different approaches. This work formulates the deficient length adaptive system problem using a Linearly Constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (LCMMSE) framework. This new formulation leads to a very interesting interpretation that allows the utilization of results from the study of constrained adaptive filters to understand the behavior of the deficient length LMS adaptive filter. The reduced number of coefficients is formulated as a linear optimization constraint that defines a projection onto the feasible space for the adaptive weight vector. We derive analytical models for the mean and mean-square behavior of the adaptive weights. In addition, we derive an analytical model for the variance of the steady-state squared estimation error which provides important design information. Simulation results show excellent matching between theory and actual algorithm behavior.}

	abstract = {Most studies of adaptive algorithm behavior consider performance measures based on mean values such as the mean value of the squared error. Behavior models based on average measures models are useful for understanding the algorithm behavior under different environments and can be used for design. Nevertheless, from a practical point of view, the adaptive filter user has only one realization of the algorithm to obtain the desired result. This article derives a model for the variance of the squared-error sample curve of the least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive algorithm, so that the achievable cancellation level can be predicted based on the properties of the steady-state squared error. The derived results provide the user with useful design guidelines.}
